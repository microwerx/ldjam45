# The Llama Paradox

The Llama Paradox is a video game based on the theme "start from nothing." The goal of the game is to create a star "resource" cluster that can grow a variety of resources. The challenge is that since the solar system is increasing in complexity, so too does navigating it because of the intertwining gravity sinks. Travel in space to other solar systems to explore the entire universe.

## Player Control

There are two main modes of operation: Design and Mine. Design Mode allows you to place the location of another star in the system. The restriction is that it must be placed no closer than one grid element away from another star and that one grid section must contain no more than a single star. Copy/Paste your own signature code to share your solar system with others.
