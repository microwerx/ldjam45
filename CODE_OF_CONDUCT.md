# Code of Conduct

(Mark 12:28-31) "Â¶ And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?  {29} And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:  {30} And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.  {31} And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these."

Seems easy enough. Brian Lunduke has a phrase I like: "Be excellent to each other."
